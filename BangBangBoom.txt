WHITE LINES, PRETTY BABY, TATTOOS,
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN,
THEY'RE SPECIAL, JUST FOR YOU.
WHITE PALMS, BAKING POWDER ON THE STOVE,
COOKIN' UP A DREAM,
TURNIN' DIAMONDS INTO SNOW.

I FEEL YOU, PRETTY BABY, FEEL ME,
TURN IT UP HOT, LOVIN' YOU IS FREE.
I LIKE IT DOWN, LIKE IT DOWN WAY LOW,
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, YOU ALREADY KNOW.

COME ON DOWN TO FLORIDA,
I GOT SOMETHIN' FOR YA.
WE COULD SEE THE KILOS,
ON THE KEYS, BABY, OH YEAH.

GUNS IN THE SUMMERTIME,
DRINK A CHERRY COLA LIME.
PRISON ISN'T NOTHIN' TO ME,
IF YOU'LL BE BY MY SIDE.

YAYO, YAYO, YAYO,
AND ALL THE DOPE FIENDS
YAYO, YAYO, YAYO.

SUN IN MY MOUTH AND GOLD HOOPS,
YOU LIKE YOUR LITTLE BABY,
LIKE YOU LIKE YOUR DRINKS COOL.
WHITE LINES, PRETTY DADDY GOLD SKIN,
YOU SNORT IT LIKE A CHAMP,
LIKE THE WINTER WE'RE NOT IN.

COME ON DOWN TO FLORIDA,
I GOT SOMETHIN' FOR YA.
WE COULD SEE THE KILOS,
ON THE KEYS, BABY, OH YEAH.

GUNS IN THE SUMMERTIME,
DRINK A CHERRY COLA LIME.
PRISON ISN'T NOTHIN' TO ME,
IF YOU'LL BE BY MY SIDE.

YAYO, YAYO, YAYO,
AND ALL THE DOPE FIENDS
YAYO, YAYO, YAYO.

WE COULD GET HIGH IN MIAMI,
OOH, DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY.
PEOPLE NEVER DIE IN MIAMI,
OOH, THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

(YOU BELIEVE ME, DON'T YOU, BABY?)

COME ON DOWN TO FLORIDA,
I GOT SOMETHIN' FOR YA.
WE COULD SEE THE KILOS,
ON THE KEYS, BABY, OH YEAH.

GUNS IN THE SUMMERTIME,
CHICA CHERRY COLA LIME.
PRISON DON'T MEAN NOTHIN' TO ME,
IF YOU'LL BE BY MY SIDE.

YAYO, YAYO, YAYO,
ALL THE FLORIDIANS SAY,
YAYO, YAYO, YAYO,
ALL THE COLOMBIANS SAY,
YAYO, YAYO, YAYO,
AND ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS,
